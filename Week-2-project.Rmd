I downlaoded the data "Librar-small.rda" provided by professor Danny Kaplan (https://dtkaplan.github.io/comp110/Projects/251-Library-Books-github.html).

##Basics
```{r}
load("Library-small.rda")
```

```{r}
nrow(Bks)
nrow(Inv)
```
```{r}
names(Bks)
names(Inv)
```
```{r}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Current.Status) %>%
  tally()
```
```{r}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Issued.Count) %>%
  tally()
```
